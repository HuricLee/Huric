                                    After discussion in our group today,
                                    we decided to continue the game in the first semester and make the second level.
                                    The setting is set in a hospital. The division of labor is similar to that in the first semester.
                                    I will be responsible for the main program, logic and implementation mechanism.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In terms of mechanic implementation, many things can be used in the first level, such as maps, packs, energy.
                                    In this level, I need to complete the energy system and optimize some functions of the first level.
                                    I want to be different from the first level.

                                    Before designing the game mechanics,
                                    I first thought about what I wanted to continue to discuss and research in this game.
                                    In the first level, I mainly explored how to design the right mechanics in such a game.
                                    At this level, I want to go deeper, how much does the design of the mechanics affect the game, and how does it affect the main character?
                                    How much does it affect the player's experience?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition, I learned the term immersion for the first time last semester, but many students, including me, were advised that immersion was not specific enough.
                                    So this time I want to understand what immersion is and how to improve the player's experience. Also, does the game have to deliver something? Most of the time, games are just a tool for people's entertainment, but the more I learn about them, the more I realize that games have a lot of functions and value.

                                    First, the design and construction of the scene. Due to time constraints, we still used existing material for the scenes.
                                    Today, I looked for the scene materials of the second level with my friends.
                                    An official resource pack for Unreal Engine was found, but UE was not installed.
                                    So I went to install UE and try to check the required hospital scene materials.

                                    Today, I imported the scene into UE and found that all the material formats were in UE format, which could not be used directly.
                                    I preliminarily understood the operation mode of UE and exported the model,
                                    but there was no material for the FBX model. Then,
                                    I had to export each part individually and fill each material one by one in Unity. In addition,
                                    I learned some specific details of URP material in Unity,
                                    learned the meaning of exported “_AO”(ambient occlusion), “_R”(roughness), “_M”(metallic) and
                                    other texture formats, which could be fille into  corresponding part of the URP material.
                                    I really learned something new. I was actually a bit confused about the material before.

                                    Today, I moved the main character to the game scene, as well as the UI.
                                    I found some difficulties in the code, because although the reuse of the code was considered in the first level,
                                    some temporary added codes could not be used due to the lack of consideration in the production,
                                    so it may take some time to modify or rewrite some codes in the second level development.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Specifically, in the backpack system made in the first level,
                                    some items are judged by tag and some by name,
                                    resulting in some inconsistent codes.
                                    At the same time, the code reuse of specific items in the first level is not high,
                                    which is the result of the lack of design in the early stage.
                                </p>

                                            <br />
                                            The scripts controlling the Bag system mainly concerns
                                            <br />
                                            <cs>NarrativeTrigger.cs</cs> and <cs>BackpackControl.cs</cs>
                                            <br />
                                            Firstly I set tags for different props
                                            <br />
                                            For example:
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                        </coding>
                                        <pre>
<annotation>    //refers to the computer UI panel</annotation>
    m_ComputerTag = "computer";
<annotation>    //refers to the log objects in the scene</annotation>
    m_PropTag = "Props";
<annotation>    //refers to the cabinet which could be open</annotation>
    m_WallCabinetTag = "wallcabinet";

    .......
</pre>
                                        <coding>
                                            Obviously, objets will be detected by method <function>OnTriggerEnter()</function>.
                                            To generalize the coding, I set variables (private Gameobject) for all the triggered objects.
                                            In this way, everytime the player triggers an object,it will be recorded in <cs>NarrativeTrigger.cs</cs>
                                            <br />
                                            The input of Keycode.F is the interacting key, which almost controlls all the interactions.
                                            With triggered objects and interacting input, it goes to the function <function>InteractObjects()</function>.
                                            <br />
                                            Here is the important part. With the logic above, I could add more certain functions tageting different objects;
                                            More importantly, besides the backpack system, I also wrote other reusable functions. Actually, this behaviour is required.
                                            <br />
                                            For example:
                                            <br /> <br />
                                        </coding>
<pre>
<function>    InteractObjects()</function>
    {
<annotation>    //functions of level 1</annotation>
    if (m_Log)
    GetLogIntoBag();
    if (m_WallCabinet)
    OpenOrCloseCabinet();
    if (m_ComputerPanel)
    OpenComputer();
<annotation>    //functions of level 2</annotation>
    if (m_Fashengqi ||m_Core)
    GetPartsIntoBag();
    if (m_Flyr)
    SupplyEnergy();
    if (m_PasswordPadPanel)
    OpenPasswordPad();
    if (metalDoor&&!buttonPart)
    OperateMetalDoor();
    if (buttonPart)
    GetButtonIntoBag();
    if (m_Energy)
    GetEnergy();
    }

                                    After a few days of on-off modifications, the main features were mostly ported to the level 2 scene.
                                    With the preparation work completed, the next step is to set up the mechanism and consider the research problem.
                                    When making the first level, I paid more attention to the design of the mechanics,
                                    and actually I didn't think about the overall feeling of the game as a player.
                                    When I settled down to play the game, carefully read the log and listened to every robot voice,
                                    I felt I was truly immersed in the story and explored as Iron.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I started to think about the expressiveness of the game,
                                    whether we were communicating our ideas to the players.
                                    As an RPG, the game doesn't actually have the traditional RPG features,
                                    but is more about deciphering and exploration. So what is the progression of the game?
                                    So, I read about it and wanted to know the elements of an RPG.
                                    A basic definition of an RPG is usually a description of agency and experience.
                                    One of the things I was impressed profoundly is that <i><a href="https://nordiclarp.org/w/images/7/74/2006-Role.Play.Art.pdf">Petterson (2006) </a></i>calling RPGS art of Experience.
                                    In terms of giving the player a game experience,
                                    it is worth pondering whether the level of esthetics can be achieved.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once by chance, I saw an article about <i><a href="https://pavcreations.com/level-systems-and-character-growth-in-rpg-games/">Level system and character growth in RPG games</a></i>,
                                    and the author gave a relatively accurate growth curve by referring to bloodo mathematical formula,
                                    which inspired me to explore the growth of characters.
                                    But there was a conflict point where I saw that our characters were not
                                    the traditional RPG human protagonists, so where did we grow? And that got me thinking.
                                    I found that growth is not just about upgrading and strengthening abilities,
                                    but also about the improvement and further shaping of character image, which is a gradual process.

                                <p>
                                    Consequently, I wanted to ask the question, is there a difference between non-human RPGs and others?
                                    Are these games more about delivering fun or are they usually
                                    about delivering the unique meaning of the main character?

                                    Our group further discussed the mechanism of the second level of the game,
                                    and determined the basic gameplay and main mechanism of our game.
                                    In addition, we refered to the game atmosphere and puzzling of Resident Evil Ⅱ.

                                    And then again, energy harvesting, which is the core of our game.

                                    After the group discussion about mechanics,
                                    I suddenly got inspired on my research question.
                                    RPGS have a progression system, so in characters,
                                    which is called <i>Character Progression</i>.
                                    But in practice, few researchers have researched into this filed.
                                    The word <i>Character Progression</i> may first be proposed by <a href="https://lonewarriorswa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Playing-at-the-World-book.pdf">Peterson (2012) </a>
                                    in his discussion of <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> mechanism.

                                    Intruingly, "much of the literature on role-playing games (RPGs) focuses on their social, performative, experiential, and/or narrative aspects.
                                    The emphasis is on the playing of the roles, as it were, and less so on the game mechanics.
                                    Curiously, the phrase RPG elements tends not to refer to the role-playing aspects of the genre,
                                    but to the rules, systems, and mechanisms that have been co-opted by other game genres and gamification practitioners."
                                    By examining a single element: mechanisms and systems for <i><a href="https://my.eng.utah.edu/~zagal/Papers/Zagal_Altizer_RPG_Elements_Progression.pdf">Character Progression</a></i> in RPGs we can unpack the term ‘RPG elements’.

                                    This further inspired me to think about the research problem.
                                    The core of the question is not the genre, but what it carries.

                                    The character progression attribute is represented by Iron, and one of the systems is the energy system.
                                    The player can gain energy by accomplishing missions and passing the level while risking death if losing it.
                                    This is a rewarding and punishment mechanic that drives the player to complete the quest.

                                            I made it by instantiating twenty units of energy,
                                            which is a very basic implementation method that I'll go over here.
                                            On the UI, the energy color changes depending on the amount of energy,
                                            and a flash alerts the player when energy is too little.

                                            I also used this script in other functions several times.
                                            Likewise, IEnumerator is used in this script to make this effect.

                                    The way our mechanics were set up, not only did energy decrease over time,
                                    but some interactions in the game also caused energy to decrease.
                                    When I was thinking about how to present this mechanic,
                                    I realized that some seemingly meaningless mechanics could actually exist in the game,
                                    such as making the player make choices.

                                    I got to understand for the first time the widespread use of the word Eudaimonia in the field of games
                                    and how it is often used to evaluate a game. Games serve for the player,
                                    so creating experiences is a must, and there seems to be no limit to the level of experience,
                                    as if happiness will never peak, and games can continue to create more and more Eudaimonic experiences.

                                    What experiences can we create for our players with regard to our games?
                                    First of all, as a player, I think it's easy for players to empathize with Iron from the first level.
                                    In order to strengthen this connection, we need to add more elements to support it in the second level.

                                    According to our mechanics, energy, in addition to decreasing over time, can also be used to participate in interactions within the scene. But as mentioned earlier, we want to give the player choices, and avoid choices that tend to win. And that's actually what I did.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Every single room in the scene has a door, and each time the player opens the door, energy is consumed. However, having a room in it actually has no effect on the progress of the game. Such an empty space exists in most games, and it gives the player some space to explore (Figure 2). So, after entering an unhelpful room, the player might think twice before using energy to open the door.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition, In the design of opening the door, I also made a mechanism that gradually charged the door and then opened it. In such details, the game's progression system can be solid, with energy-deficient doors slowly opening only after they are fully charged. This is not only a interesting mechanic, but also a way to suppress the desire of some players to finish the game and make them feel more relaxed.

                                            As shown in Figure 3 and4, to implement the effect that the emission fades out from the center,
                                            I mainly add an offset variable to the x axis of the emission picture.
                                            The reason for the x axis is based on the appearance of the door that the energy slots are distributed on the top center and the bottom center.

                                    There needs to be some freedom in the player's exploration, but at the same time the game should be guided so that the player doesn't lose passively. In order to prevent the player from being confused and unable to play the game smoothly due to wandering around using energy at random, I introduced a quest prompt system.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The quest system is something that most games have, especially if they have a story. I designed the mission system in places that required the player to do different things. It is very important for the content design to be vague and prompt, allowing the player to follow certain game logic while having freedom.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The appearance and dynamic effect of the mission system are based on the task prompt effect in Need for Speed 18 (Figure 1), which is displayed in the right middle of the interface in translucent gradient color, which not only prompts the mission, but also is very beautiful.

                                            The code part of the mission system is where the logic is most needed, and failing to put the story together runs the risk of repeating the same mistakes. Therefore, I divided the story into simple classes, and used a unified format to wrap each story point with functions, which is more logical.

                                    Creating an atmosphere is essential to enhance the player's experience.
                                    When people focus on a game's mechanics, they tend to focus on its sound, scenery, and graphics.
                                    While some non-essential elements, such as graphics quality, are not the same as game quality,
                                    they play a big role in creating a game experience.

                                    Our game character as a robot lacks social connectedness with a human. So I did a lot of work on surroundings and atmosphere in this regard.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    First of all, the environment atmosphere is created. As the setting is the abandoned future human world, the hospital has been abandoned.
                                    So I designed to add some other robots in the hospital, and they are running out of energy or about to run out:
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-size:18px; color: dimgray">
                                    ● When entering the game, the player will encounter zombie robots, who are dead but still have little energy.
                                    As the player approaches, they will pounce on Iron. We have not set whether it is for help or other purposes,
                                    so that the player can understand it from his own perspective (Figure 1).

                                    ● Before the player enters the morgue, there is a black fog effect, and we want to remind the player that something different is coming (Figure 2).
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-size:18px; color: dimgray">
                                    ● The moment the player open the door to the morgue through the dark fog, he or she will be greeted by a swarm of flying insects, in keeping with the idea that some abandoned dark scenes are always full of strange creatures (Figure 3).
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-size:18px; color: dimgray">
                                    ● We have arranged different environmental sound effects in different scenes. There will be wind in passages and halls, and the wind will be more violent in narrow passages.
                                    The most special setting is the sound of electrocardiogram monitors in the operating room, creating a hospital atmosphere (Figure 4).
